# python-challenge
Working with CSV files in Python - one is a budget and one is election data. The goals of these exercises were similar, so the scripts follow a similar process.

PSEUDOCODE: <br />
create a path strings for input and output<br />
initialize variables<br />
with an open csv:<br />
   skip header<br />
   for each subsequent row in csv:<br />
      calculate variables based on values in row<br />
print results<br />
save results to csv.

I consulted Google and python.org to get clarification on some functions, and we did an example with tallies in a dictionary in class, but the code in both files was written by me.
