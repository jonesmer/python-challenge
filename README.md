Working with CSV files in Python - one is a budget and one is election data.

Both of these exercises had similar goals, so the pseudocode is similar for both:

  create a path strings for input and output
  initialize variables
  open csv
    skip header
    for each subsequent row in csv:
      calculate variables based on values in row
  print results
  save results to csv

I consulted Google and python.org to get clarification on some functions, and we did an example with tallies in a dictionary in class, but the code in both files was written by me.
